Express Headstart
=================

### Start your next Express web app in minutes.

Express does come with its own scaffolding tool (`bin/express`) to get you started. I have customized the initial scaffold to suit my taste;

* [jQuery 1.10.2](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [Modernizr 2.7.0](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr)
* [Skeleton CSS 1.2](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton)
* [Navigataur CSS](https://github.com/micjamking/Navigataur)
* [Smush](https://github.com/vnykmshr/node-smush)

### Getting started

* Get headstart `git clone git@github.com:vnykmshr/headstart.git`
* Install Packages `cd headstart && npm install`
* Copy config `cp sample-config.js config.js`
* Minify assets `./bin/minify`
* Test start server `node app`
* Update remote upstream to your own repository, and do a initial commit.
* Start hacking the code to suit your taste.

If you face any issues, just drop me a message. I will be more than happy to help you out.
